# Lung-Diseases-Detection
## Overview
This program utilizes a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for the multiclass classification of lung diseases. The model is trained to differentiate between normal lungs, coronavirus, bacterial pneumonia, tuberculosis (TB), and viral pneumonia by analyzing X-ray images. This project was developed and executed on Google Colab.

## Features
Multiclass Classification: Differentiates between five classes of lung conditions.
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN): Leverages deep learning techniques for accurate image classification.
